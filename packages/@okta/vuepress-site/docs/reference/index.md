Okta APIs generally fall two categories: signing in your users, and managing
resources in your Okta org.

## Sign in Your Users
API endpoints to authenticate your users, challenge for factors, recover passwords, and more. [Learn about which APIs to use.](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#authentication-api-vs-oauth-20-vs-openid-connect)
